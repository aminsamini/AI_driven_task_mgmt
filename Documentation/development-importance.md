| ID | Date | Severity | Description | Impact | Solution | Status | Related ID |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| deim_0001 | 2025-11-27 19:30 | High | `main.py` used incorrect `InMemoryRunner` with `DatabaseSessionService` and incorrect initialization. | Verification failed, agent could not run with persistence. | Switched to `Runner` and fixed `DatabaseSessionService` initialization. | Solved | dehi_0002 |
| deim_0002 | 2025-11-27 21:45 | High | Agents lacked a standardized protocol for context awareness. | Risk of conflicts, redundant work, and pattern violations. | Established Mandatory Agent Protocol in `development-rules-and-path.md`. | Improved | dehi_0003 |
| deim_0003 | 2025-11-27 22:20 | High | `AttributeError: module 'google.genai.types' has no attribute 'CompactionConfig'` prevented agent startup. | Agent failed to initialize. | Corrected import path for `CompactionConfig` to `google.adk.agents`. | Solved | dehi_0006 |
| deim_0004 | 2025-11-27 22:30 | High | `CompactionConfig` class not found in `google-adk` package despite documentation. | Context compaction feature cannot be implemented as planned. | Reverted changes to `main.py` to restore basic functionality. | Open | dehi_0007 |
| deim_0005 | 2025-11-27 16:48:42 | High | The application's security posture has been significantly improved with the implementation of a new authentication and session management system. However, it is crucial to remain vigilant and continuously monitor for potential vulnerabilities. | Unauthorized access to the system could lead to data breaches, malicious use of the agent's tools, and other security incidents. | - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing. - Implement a more robust rate-limiting mechanism to protect against brute-force attacks. - Consider adding multi-factor authentication for an extra layer of security. | Improved | dehi_0008 |
