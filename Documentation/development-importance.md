# Development Importance & Issues

| ID | Date | Severity | Description | Impact | Solution | Status | Related ID |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| deim_0001 | 2025-11-27 19:30 | High | `main.py` used incorrect `InMemoryRunner` with `DatabaseSessionService` and incorrect initialization. | Verification failed, agent could not run with persistence. | Switched to `Runner` and fixed `DatabaseSessionService` initialization. | Solved | dehi_0002 |
| deim_0002 | 2025-11-27 21:45 | High | Agents lacked a standardized protocol for context awareness. | Risk of conflicts, redundant work, and pattern violations. | Established Mandatory Agent Protocol in `development-rules-and-path.md`. | Improved | dehi_0003 |
| deim_0003 | 2025-11-27 22:20 | High | `AttributeError: module 'google.genai.types' has no attribute 'CompactionConfig'` prevented agent startup. | Agent failed to initialize. | Corrected import path for `CompactionConfig` to `google.adk.agents`. | Solved | dehi_0006 |
| deim_0004 | 2025-11-27 22:30 | High | `CompactionConfig` class not found in `google-adk` package despite documentation. | Context compaction feature cannot be implemented as planned. | Reverted changes to `main.py` to restore basic functionality. | Open | dehi_0007 |
| deim_0005 | 2025-11-27 16:48:42 | High | The application's security posture has been significantly improved with the implementation of a new authentication and session management system. However, it is crucial to remain vigilant and continuously monitor for potential vulnerabilities. | Unauthorized access to the system could lead to data breaches, malicious use of the agent's tools, and other security incidents. | - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing. - Implement a more robust rate-limiting mechanism to protect against brute-force attacks. - Consider adding multi-factor authentication for an extra layer of security. | Improved | dehi_0008 |
| deim_0006 | 2025-11-28 15:05 | Medium | Account creation process appeared to hang after email entry due to `getpass` prompt visibility issues in some terminals. | Users could not complete registration, leading to a broken onboarding experience. | Implemented explicit print statements and `sys.stdout.flush()` to ensure prompts are visible and input is handled correctly. | Solved | dehi_0009 |
| deim_0007 | 2025-11-28 15:10 | Medium | `getpass` continued to cause hangs or failed to capture input in the user's environment despite previous fixes. | User was blocked from creating an account. | Replaced `getpass` with `sys.stdin.readline()`. Password input is now visible, which is a security trade-off for usability in this development environment. | Solved | dehi_0010 |
| deim_0008 | 2025-11-28 15:14 | High | `passlib` raised `MissingBackendError` because `bcrypt` was not installed, despite being in `requirements.txt`. | Account creation failed with a runtime error. | Manually installed `bcrypt` using `pip`. | Solved | dehi_0011 |
| deim_0009 | 2025-11-28 15:18 | High | `passlib` raised `AttributeError: module 'bcrypt' has no attribute '__about__'` due to incompatibility with `bcrypt` >= 4.1.0. | Account creation failed with a runtime error. | Downgraded `bcrypt` to version 4.0.1 and pinned it in `requirements.txt`. | Solved | dehi_0012 |
| deim_0010 | 2025-11-28 15:22 | High | `DatabaseSessionService.get_session` raised `TypeError` due to missing `user_id` argument. | Application crashed immediately after authentication. | Updated `main.py` to pass `user_id=user.id` to `get_session` and `delete_session` calls. | Canceled | dehi_0013 |
| deim_0011 | 2025-11-28 15:35 | High | `NameError: name 'init_db' is not defined` in `main.py` due to missing import. | Application failed to start. | Restored `from database import init_db` in `main.py`. | Solved | dehi_0014 |
| deim_0012 | 2025-11-29 19:10 | Medium | Circular import in `tools/__init__.py` caused `passlib` dependency error in scripts not needing auth. | Verification scripts failed. | Removed `from . import auth` from `tools/__init__.py` as `cli.py` imports `auth` directly. | Solved | dehi_0025 |
| deim_0013 | 2025-11-30 16:10 | High | Missing `itsdangerous` dependency and `passlib` installation issues prevented server start. | Web UI server failed to start. | Added `itsdangerous` to `requirements.txt` and manually installed `passlib`. | Solved | dehi_0028 |
| deim_0014 | 2025-11-30 19:10 | Low | Backend now performs a manual join between Task and User tables to fetch assignee names. | Potential performance impact with large datasets; lacks SQLAlchemy relationship optimization. | Optimize with SQLAlchemy relationships in future refactoring. | Open | dehi_0029 |
